    <h2>How To Make Potato Pancakes</h2>
    <p>These traditional potato pancakes are wonderful comfort food. Serve with applesauce and sour 
        cream for a light dinner, or with roast chicken for a hearty winter meal.</p>
   
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large potatoes</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Finely grate potatoes and onion into a large bowl. Drain off any excess liquid</li>
      <li>Mix in egg, salt, and pepper. Add enough flour to make the mixture thick, about 2 to 4 
        tablespoons all together</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to low, about 200 degrees F (95 degrees C)</li>
      <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in the bottom of a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Drop two or three 
        1/4-cup mounds of batter into hot oil, and flatten with back of a spatula to make 
        1/2-inch-thick pancakes. Fry, turning pancakes once, until golden brown. </li>
      <li>Transfer pancakes to a plate lined with a paper towel to drain. Keep warm in the oven until 
        serving. Repeat until all potato mixture is used. </li>
    </ol>
